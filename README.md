# Data Science Assignments

This repository holds my Jupyter Notebook notes and assignments for the Part II Data Science course of my degree. All code is in Python.

Each practical folder contains all code used to learn to content, understand the assignment/ data and complete the practical. Each file was written fully from scratch but does contain some work copied over from the course notes.

Note: The final assignment was a large project in which we had 48 hours to "build a machine learning pipeline to predict the target value based on the other demographic and employment related variables in a subset of [CENSUS-INCOME (KDD) DATA SET](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+%28KDD%29)"
